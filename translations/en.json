The firm invests in the client with a remuneration based on a success fee and must therefore assess the feasibility of the fundrising operation. This step is essential as it represents for us an investment both in consulting and in building relationships. Only at the end of this phase, and after verifying the conditions, will we proceed with the signing of the mandate.",

    "transparencyAndProfessionalism": "Transparency and professionalism",
    "transparencyDescription": "A retainer fee communicates to the client that the professional operates in a structured and transparent manner, with a constant commitment and clear planning, rather than relying solely on success-based fees, which may appear speculative.",

    "dedicatedCommitment": "Dedicated commitment and allocated resources",
    "dedicatedCommitmentDescription": "The retainer fee ensures that the professional or team dedicates specific resources to the project. Fundraising is a process that requires time, expertise, and access to a qualified network of investors. The retainer fee covers these initial operating costs.",
    "riskMitigation": "Risk mitigation for the professional",
    "riskMitigationDescription": "Fundraising, especially for start-ups or complex projects, can take many months with no guarantee of success. The retainer fee helps cover part of the risk associated with the time and resources invested before achieving tangible results with the success fee.",
    "fundraisingStrategy": "Development of fundraising strategy",
    "fundraisingStrategyDescription": "Fundraising often requires the development of a tailored strategy, including market analysis, opportunity assessment, and preparation of promotional and financial materials. The retainer fee covers these strategic activities, which are crucial to the success of the fundraising.",
    "ongoingCommitment": "Ongoing commitment",
    "ongoingCommitmentDescription": "A fixed fee demonstrates mutual commitment between the client and the professional. It acts as a form of assurance that the client is genuinely motivated and involved in the process, reducing the risk of investing time and resources in a project that is not adequately supported by the client.",

    "riskLevel": "Risk level of the operation",
    "riskLevelDescription": "If the operation presents a high degree of risk, the retainer fee tends to be higher to cover the initial investment needed to develop an effective strategy. Riskier projects require more significant effort in terms of analysis and preparation.",
    "complexity": "Complexity of the fundraising strategy",
    "complexityDescription": "Operations that require the development of complex and tailored strategies, such as targeting different types of investors or markets, may justify a higher retainer fee. The time needed to plan the approach can be substantial.",
    "companyPreparation": "Companyâ€™s level of preparation",
    "companyPreparationDescription": "If the company is already well-structured and has ready materials like a business plan, financial model, and investor presentations, the retainer fee might be lower. On the contrary, if the professional needs to assist in creating these elements, the fee will be higher.",
    "estimatedDuration": "Estimated process duration",
    "estimatedDurationDescription": "A longer fundraising process requires ongoing commitment from the professional. The longer the estimated duration, the higher the retainer fee to cover the resources used over time.",
    "industry": "Industry of the company",
    "industryDescription": "Highly specialized or innovative sectors, such as advanced technology, biotech, or renewable energy, may require specialized expertise and access to a particular network of investors, which increases the cost of the retainer fee.",
    "investorType": "Type of investors to involve",
    "investorTypeDescription": "The type of target investors, such as venture capital, institutional funds, or business angels, can influence the cost of the retainer fee. Involving institutional investors often requires more preparation and complex negotiations.",
    "clientNetwork": "State of the clientâ€™s network",
    "clientNetworkDescription": "If the client already has a network of potential investors or has started the process, the retainer fee might be more contained. If, instead, the professional has to build and manage the entire network of contacts and relationships, the retainer fee will be higher.",
    "dedicatedCommitment": "Dedicated commitment and allocated resources",
    "dedicatedCommitmentDescription": "If the professional or team needs to dedicate significant resources and time to the project, the retainer fee will be higher to cover the initial operational costs necessary to ensure the mandateâ€™s effectiveness.",
    "operationSize": "Size of the operation",

This type of compensation aligns the interests of the client and the professional, as both benefit from the success of the operation.\n\nNormally, the success fee is calculated as a percentage of the total amount raised, and in venture capital or start-up fundraising contexts, it varies based on the following factors:\n\nThe percentage of the success fee in a fundraising process can vary depending on several variables that reflect the complexity, risk, and value of the project. Here are some of the main factors that can influence the percentage:",
    "totalFundraisingAmount": "Total fundraising amount",
    "totalFundraisingAmountDescription": "If the fundraising involves large amounts, the success fee percentage might be lower (e.g., 3%-5%), as the total compensation will still be significant. For smaller amounts, the percentage could be higher to compensate for the work done.",
    "projectRiskLevel": "Project risk level",
    "projectRiskLevelDescription": "A high-risk project or an early-stage start-up might justify a higher success fee (e.g., 6%-10%), as the risk of not completing the fundraising is greater, and the professional must invest more resources.",
    "industry": "Industry",
    "industryDescription": "More innovative or complex sectors (e.g., advanced technology, biotech) may require specific expertise and a niche network of investors, leading to a higher success fee, while more traditional and less risky sectors may require a lower percentage.",
    "maturityLevel": "Maturity level of the company",
    "maturityLevelDescription": "Established companies or those with a validated business model tend to have a lower success fee percentage than early-stage start-ups, which may face more obstacles in attracting capital.",
    "estimatedProcessDuration": "Estimated process duration",
    "estimatedProcessDurationDescription": "Fundraising processes that require long durations and multiple iterations with investors may result in a higher success fee to compensate for the prolonged effort. Conversely, shorter processes or those involving already interested investors may justify a lower percentage.",
    "typeOfInvestors": "Type of investors involved",
    "typeOfInvestorsDescription": "If fundraising targets institutional investors or venture capital funds with long decision-making processes and complex negotiations, the success fee may be higher compared to those involving private or angel investors with faster processes.",
    "preparationProgress": "Preparation progress",
    "preparationProgressDescription": "If the company already has well-developed presentation materials (business plan, financial model) and an initial network of investor contacts, the fundraising process will be smoother, potentially leading to a lower success fee. If, instead, significant intervention is needed to structure the company and prepare it for fundraising, the fee may be higher.",
    "exclusivity": "Exclusivity or non-exclusivity of the mandate",

    "marketConditionsDescription": "General market conditions and the availability of capital for investment can impact the ease or difficulty of raising funds, influencing the success fee percentage."
